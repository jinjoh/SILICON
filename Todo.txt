template matching:

- Cancel button and real progress for template matching

- Use threading when matching multiple templates (batch mode). This
  should improve performance on multi core processors. (Function add_gate() is
  a critical section.)

- Dect: scaling = 2 && flipping -> wrong position

- save template matching params

- prio 0: (global) project setting - which flip-types are possible
   -> reduce false positives in tmpl matching, speedup
- test for best orientation

project:

- wizard for creating a project (set layer type / import image)
  - determine project w/h by image size
- add / remove layer

=> a generic layer config win

UI:

- collapse toolbar
- crontrol-mouse move same as move
- remember path in file dialogs
- ask: project-save on window-close (todo: check, if it works on ubuntu)
- highlight all isolated ports and the gate, if all ports are isolated

- scroll problem: scrollbar is top, but it's not really the top

- "Select all objects in region"
- "Select all gates in region"
- "Select all wires in region"
- "Select all via in region"

- edit/create gate:
  - default fill alpha: 0
  - checkboxes for in/out

renderer:

- frame border should be outside of gates
- draw strings to the left of a port, if there is space
- linebreaked gate strings

misc:

- export netlist
- export placements

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Use cmake to generate makefiles and configure scripts.
  -> build platform
- Rendering human readable cicuit schematics.
  (Maybe as an extern tool with user interaction and from/to degate.)
- Icarus Verilog?
